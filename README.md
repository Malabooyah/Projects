A command-line Blackjack game built in Python that simulates a real game of Blackjack between a player and a dealer. The project uses object-oriented programming to model cards, decks, hands, and gameplay logic while following standard Blackjack rules.

This project was created to strengthen Python fundamentals, OOP design, and debugging skills through a hands-on, interactive application.

🚀 Features

-Interactive command-line gameplay

-Player options to Hit or Stand

-Dealer follows standard Blackjack rules (hits until 17)

-Automatic hand value calculation with Ace adjustment (11 or 1)

-Detection of Blackjack, busts, ties, and wins

-Support for playing multiple games in a single session

🛠️ Tech Stack

-Python

-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-Control flow and loops

-User input handling

-Game state management

🧱 Project Structure

-Card — Represents a single playing card with rank and suit

-Deck — Creates, shuffles, and deals cards

-Hand — Tracks cards in a hand and calculates hand value

-Game — Manages gameplay flow, player input, and win conditions

▶️ How to Run

-> Make sure Python 3 is installed

-> Clone the repository

-> Run the game from the terminal:

python main.py


-> Follow the on-screen prompts to play
